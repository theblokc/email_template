        <p><strong>Hi John Doe!</strong></p>
        <p>Warmest greetings!</p>
        <p>
          Blockchain Technology has revolutionized the way we do business, and
          we believe staying up-to-date on the latest developments and
          innovations in this field is indispensable for industry leaders like
          yourself. The BLOKC, a leading enabler of blockchain education,
          training and certification in the Philippines through its student
          organization the Junior Blockchain Education Consortium of the
          Philippines (JBECP), would like to invite you to be our esteemed
          partner for our upcoming Blockchain Campus Conference, with a theme
          “Empowerment through education, experience and events” to be held on
          <strong>the 10th and 11th of October, 2024. </strong> from
          <strong>9AM</strong> to <strong>5PM</strong> at the
          <strong>Mapua Malayan Colleges Mindanao, Davao, Philippines.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          As a pioneer blockchain social impact enterprise in the Philippines,
          The BLOKC aims to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology in
          the country through community and ecosystem building, bootcamps and
          knowledge-sharing, thus culminating in “UNBLOKC“, our flagship local
          hackathon that will be showcased in the upcoming Blockchain Campus
          Conference. As one of the highlights of the event, UNBLOKC is poised
          to light a fire of ingenuity, fueling more development of blockchain
          solutions that would impact the lives of Filipino people.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a distinguished leader in the industry, we firmly believe that your
          institution’s experience and expertise align seamlessly with our
          upcoming initiatives. The success of Blockchain Campus Conference
          greatly relies on individuals and institutions such as yourself.
          Having you on board as a partner for this event presents a remarkable
          opportunity to showcase your institution's exceptional talent and
          establish invaluable connections with industry professionals and
          thought leaders. We hope for your participation and support in this
          groundbreaking event through sponsorships, knowledge-sharing and

          The Blockchain Campus Conference is endorsed by the Commission on
          Higher Education (CHED) through CHEDRO-III Memorandum No. 58, series
          of 2024, and supported by significant government stakeholders such as
          the Department of Science and Technology - Advanced Science and
          Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI), Department of Information and
          Communications Technology (DICT), and the Department of Trade and
          Industry (DTI). This endorsement underscores the conference's
          importance and its role in fostering dialogue between academia,
          industry, and government on the critical issues facing our society
          today here in the Philippines.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have invited a wide range of experts to grace the conference and
          inspire participants to make the Philippines the Blockchain Capital of
          the World. Have the opportunity to learn from and engage with these
          experts and connect with like-minded individuals who are as passionate
          about transformative business models and committed to the development
          of blockchain technology in the country as you are.
